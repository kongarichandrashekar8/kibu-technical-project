# Kibu Technical Project

Thank you, I'm grateful for the opportunity to proceed to this round, the project was interesting, and I tried my best to give best user experience.  

**Design Decisions:**

1. From project description I understand that viewing and creating/updating notes for a user are main parts of  this project, so I wanted these parts should occupy more screen space and minimum effort to do these operations as per "Principle of Least Effort" and "Fitts's Law,‚Äù. So I made left part of the screen for viewing and creating the notes and members, where as right part mainly for updating and notes operations(deletion, audit log).

1. Notes creation requires minimum effort, when you click on + icon, it will create new note and focus the text area so you can directly write it and save.

1. Viewing members, deleting note and viewing edit log/restoring note are can do in few clicks.

Note: I allocated the majority of my time to ensure cover of all application features. Therefore, I didn't prioritize responsiveness. Please disregard any issues related to responsiveness.

**Instructions to run application:**


Git repo: https://github.com/kongarichandrashekar8/kibu-technical-project

1. Clone the repo or download the repo and unzip it.
2. Open the project in code editor(I prefer vs code).
3. Open the terminal, run the below commands

npm install

npm run dev

1. In another terminal, run below commands

npm install -g json-server

json-server --watch db.json

Please let me know if you face any errors while running the application.

**Points to consider:**

1. As per specification I utilized React Js, Typescript.
2. I used shadcn ui library for some components.


Thank you one again, I enjoyed working on this project, hoping for the best.
